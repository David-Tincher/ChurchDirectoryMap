# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a new interactive webpage that displays all New Testament Church locations across the United States on a dynamic map interface. The current church directory page provides basic links to physical locations, but lacks visual context and user-friendly navigation. The new interactive map will allow users to explore church locations geographically, making it easier for visitors to find nearby churches and understand the church's presence across the country.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the interactive map page THEN the system SHALL display a full-screen map of the United States
2. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL show all church locations as distinct pinpoints on the map
3. WHEN a user interacts with the map THEN the system SHALL allow panning, zooming, and standard map navigation
4. WHEN a user zooms in or out THEN the system SHALL maintain pinpoint visibility and clustering as appropriate

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to click on church location pinpoints, so that I can get detailed information about each specific church.

4. WHEN a user clicks outside the info window THEN the system SHALL close the popup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to search for churches by location, so that I can quickly find churches in a specific area without manually browsing the map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a city, state, or zip code in the search box THEN the system SHALL center the map on that location
2. WHEN the map centers on a searched location THEN the system SHALL highlight nearby churches within a reasonable radius
3. WHEN no churches are found near the searched location THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
4. WHEN a user clears the search THEN the system SHALL return to the default full US view

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a church administrator, I want the map to automatically pull church data from the existing directory, so that I don't have to maintain duplicate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map loads THEN the system SHALL retrieve church location data from the existing church directory source
2. WHEN church information is updated in the main directory THEN the system SHALL reflect those changes on the map
3. WHEN a church location cannot be geocoded THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue loading other locations
4. WHEN the data source is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website visitor using a mobile device, I want the interactive map to work seamlessly on my phone or tablet, so that I can find churches while traveling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN the screen size is small THEN the system SHALL adjust info windows and controls for optimal mobile viewing
4. WHEN a user rotates their device THEN the system SHALL maintain map state and adjust layout accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to get directions to a selected church, so that I can easily navigate there from my current location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a church pinpoint THEN the system SHALL provide a "Get Directions" option in the info window
2. WHEN a user clicks "Get Directions" THEN the system SHALL open the user's default map application with navigation to that church
